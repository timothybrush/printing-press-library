# War.gov UFO Goat CLI

**The declassified UAP file archive in your terminal — browse, search, and download 162+ files from the PURSUE initiative**

The first CLI for the War.gov/UFO declassified files portal. Search across all four agencies (DoD, FBI, NASA, State), download files with resume support, track new release tranches, and discover video-PDF pairings — all from a single binary with offline SQLite storage.

Created by [@davemorin](https://github.com/davemorin) (Dave Morin).

## Install

The recommended path installs both the `ufo-goat-pp-cli` binary and the `pp-ufo-goat` agent skill (Claude Code, Codex, Cursor, Gemini CLI, GitHub Copilot, and other agents supported by the upstream [`skills`](https://github.com/vercel-labs/skills) CLI) in one shot:

```bash
npx -y @mvanhorn/printing-press-library install ufo-goat
```

For CLI only (no skill):

```bash
npx -y @mvanhorn/printing-press-library install ufo-goat --cli-only
```

For skill only — installs the skill into the same agents as the default command above, but skips the CLI binary (use this to update or reinstall just the skill):

```bash
npx -y @mvanhorn/printing-press-library install ufo-goat --skill-only
```

To constrain the skill install to one or more specific agents (repeatable — agent names match the [`skills`](https://github.com/vercel-labs/skills) CLI):

```bash
npx -y @mvanhorn/printing-press-library install ufo-goat --agent claude-code
npx -y @mvanhorn/printing-press-library install ufo-goat --agent claude-code --agent codex
```

### Without Node (Go fallback)

If `npx` isn't available (no Node, offline), install the CLI directly via Go (requires Go 1.26.3 or newer):

```bash
go install github.com/mvanhorn/printing-press-library/library/other/ufo-goat/cmd/ufo-goat-pp-cli@latest
```

This installs the CLI only — no skill.

### Pre-built binary

Download a pre-built binary for your platform from the [latest release](https://github.com/mvanhorn/printing-press-library/releases/tag/ufo-goat-current). On macOS, clear the Gatekeeper quarantine: `xattr -d com.apple.quarantine <binary>`. On Unix, mark it executable: `chmod +x <binary>`.

## Install for Hermes

From the Hermes CLI:

```bash
hermes skills install mvanhorn/printing-press-library/cli-skills/pp-ufo-goat --force
```

Inside a Hermes chat session:

```bash
/skills install mvanhorn/printing-press-library/cli-skills/pp-ufo-goat --force
```

## Install for OpenClaw

Tell your OpenClaw agent (copy this):

```
Install the pp-ufo-goat skill from https://github.com/mvanhorn/printing-press-library/tree/main/cli-skills/pp-ufo-goat. The skill defines how its required CLI can be installed.
```

## Use with Claude Desktop

This CLI ships an [MCPB](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/mcpb) bundle — Claude Desktop's standard format for one-click MCP extension installs (no JSON config required).

To install:

1. Download the `.mcpb` for your platform from the [latest release](https://github.com/mvanhorn/printing-press-library/releases/tag/ufo-goat-current).
2. Double-click the `.mcpb` file. Claude Desktop opens and walks you through the install.

Requires Claude Desktop 1.0.0 or later. Pre-built bundles ship for macOS Apple Silicon (`darwin-arm64`) and Windows (`amd64`, `arm64`); for other platforms, use the manual config below.

<details>
<summary>Manual JSON config (advanced)</summary>

If you can't use the MCPB bundle (older Claude Desktop, unsupported platform), install the MCP binary and configure it manually.

```bash
go install github.com/mvanhorn/printing-press-library/library/other/ufo-goat/cmd/ufo-goat-pp-mcp@latest
```

Add to your Claude Desktop config (`~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`):

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "ufo-goat": {
      "command": "ufo-goat-pp-mcp"
    }
  }
}
```

## Authentication

No authentication required for browsing and searching the file manifest. The CSV manifest is fetched from GitHub (public). File downloads from war.gov may encounter Akamai bot protection (HTTP 403).

Environment variables:

| Variable | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `UFO_BASE_URL` | Override the base URL (default: `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DenisSergeevitch/UFO-USA/main/metadata`) |
| `UFO_CONFIG` | Override config file path (default: `~/.config/ufo-goat-pp-cli/config.json`) |

## Quick Start

```bash
# Check connectivity and local store status
ufo-goat-pp-cli doctor

# Fetch the latest file manifest from the PURSUE archive
ufo-goat-pp-cli sync

# Search across titles, descriptions, and locations
ufo-goat-pp-cli search "Apollo"

# View the chronological incident timeline
ufo-goat-pp-cli timeline --after 1960-01-01 --before 1970-12-31

# Find video-PDF pairings for cross-referencing
ufo-goat-pp-cli pairs
```

## Unique Features

These capabilities aren't available in any other tool for this API.

### Local state that compounds
- **`sync`** — Automatically detect and fetch new file tranches as the government releases them on a rolling basis

  _Agents monitoring the PURSUE release schedule get notified of new files without manual checking_

  ```bash
  ufo-goat-pp-cli sync
  ```
- **`new`** — See exactly which files were added since your last sync — the 'what did I miss' command for rolling releases

  _When an agent needs to check for new declassified files without re-scanning the entire archive_

  ```bash
  ufo-goat-pp-cli new --since 7d
  ```

### Cross-agency intelligence
- **`timeline`** — View a chronological incident timeline spanning 1944-2025 across all four agencies

  _Researchers need to see the full picture: FBI case from 1947 next to a DoD mission report from 2024_

  ```bash
  ufo-goat-pp-cli timeline --after 1940-01-01 --before 1949-12-31
  ```
- **`pairs`** — Find video-PDF pairings so researchers can locate the document that accompanies a video and vice versa

  _41 videos have paired documents — this command surfaces the connections instantly_

  ```bash
  ufo-goat-pp-cli pairs --agent
  ```
- **`agencies`** — See which agency contributed what: file counts, types, date ranges, and coverage analysis

  _Quick answer to 'what did the FBI release vs NASA vs DoD'_

  ```bash
  ufo-goat-pp-cli agencies --json
  ```
- **`locations`** — Aggregate incidents by geographic location for mapping and spatial analysis

  _Spatial patterns emerge from aggregation across all agencies_

  ```bash
  ufo-goat-pp-cli locations --json
  ```

### Agent-native plumbing
- **`download`** — Download files with resume support, verification, and progress tracking for the 2.3 GB archive

  _The archive is 2.3 GB of PDFs alone — agents need reliable batch downloads with state tracking_

  ```bash
  ufo-goat-pp-cli download --agency FBI --resume
  ```

ufo-goat-pp-cli agencies

# JSON for scripting and agents
ufo-goat-pp-cli agencies --json

# Filter to specific fields
ufo-goat-pp-cli files list --json --select id,title,agency

# CSV output
ufo-goat-pp-cli files list --csv

# Compact output (key fields only, minimal tokens)
ufo-goat-pp-cli files list --compact

# Dry run — show the request without sending
ufo-goat-pp-cli agencies --dry-run

# Agent mode — JSON + compact + no prompts in one flag
ufo-goat-pp-cli agencies --agent
```

## Agent Usage

This CLI is designed for AI agent consumption:

- **Non-interactive** — never prompts, every input is a flag
- **Pipeable** — `--json` output to stdout, errors to stderr
- **Filterable** — `--select id,title` returns only fields you need
- **Previewable** — `--dry-run` shows the request without sending
- **Read-only by default** — this CLI does not create, update, delete, publish, send, or mutate remote resources
- **Offline-friendly** — sync/search commands use the local SQLite store
- **Agent-safe by default** — no colors or formatting unless `--human-friendly` is set

Exit codes: `0` success, `2` usage error, `3` not found, `4` auth error, `5` API error, `7` rate limited, `10` config error.

## Configuration

Config file: `~/.config/ufo-goat-pp-cli/config.json`

| Variable | Description | Default |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| `UFO_BASE_URL` | Override API base URL | `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DenisSergeevitch/UFO-USA/main/metadata` |
| `UFO_CONFIG` | Override config file path | `~/.config/ufo-goat-pp-cli/config.json` |

Database: `~/.local/share/ufo-goat-pp-cli/data.db` (SQLite, created on first `sync`)

## Troubleshooting

**Config errors (exit code 10)**
- Run `ufo-goat-pp-cli doctor` to verify configuration
- Check that `~/.config/ufo-goat-pp-cli/config.json` is valid JSON (if it exists)

**Not found errors (exit code 3)**
- Check the resource ID is correct
- Run `ufo-goat-pp-cli files list` to see available items
- Run `ufo-goat-pp-cli sync` if the local store is empty

**API errors (exit code 5)**
- Check internet connectivity — the manifest is fetched from GitHub
- Run `ufo-goat-pp-cli doctor` to verify API reachability

**Rate limited (exit code 7)**
- GitHub rate limits raw content at 5000 req/hr
- Wait and retry, or use `--rate-limit 1` to throttle

### API-specific

- **403 Forbidden when downloading files** — war.gov is behind Akamai CDN and may block direct HTTP requests. Try downloading fewer files at a time.
- **Empty results from sync** — Check internet connectivity. The manifest is fetched from GitHub. Run `ufo-goat-pp-cli doctor` to verify.
- **No new files found** — New tranches are released periodically. Run `ufo-goat-pp-cli sync` to check for updates.
